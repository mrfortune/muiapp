			<h2 class="mb-2">How might we...?</h2>
			<p class="mb-2">How might we design a dashboard that allows managment of campaigns, users and assets for Fade Technology Solutions's admins, publishers, agencies and brands? We believe that by creating a centralized hub for clients to manage their
			accounts, users will be able to check on their statistics efficiently. We believe
			this because, through market research, we have found the standard for business
			management dashboards. We will know this is true when clients have a high
			success rate on tasks needed to be accomplished..

			<p class="mb-3">
		The Fade executives and techs came to us with a detailed project brief, inclding how their system worked for publishers, agencies, brands and admins and examples of Facebook Business Suite and Snapchat's Business dashboard. We did not have access to user info, nor could we interview users since their users are their business clients.</p>
		<p class="mb-3">
		We were forced to rely on the project brief and competitive analysis and comparative analysis to inform our final design decisions.</p>

				<h4>1. Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<p>Campaign managment solutions and administrative dashboards are nothing new. Many companies, such as Amazon, YouTube and Facebook alll have those solutions for their business users. We simply looked at those properties and features and applied it to Fades project brief. </p>
				<p>Fades business model is an advertiser driven model, like Facebook and Youtube, so we focused heavily on their layout and UI components including analytics. Fade has no direct competitors based on their unique offering.</p>
				<h6>Observations:</h6>
				<ul>
				<li>Dashboards all have analytics and charts and features to maipulate the data.</li>
				<li>There are access and privilege levels assigned to users including who has administrative rights.</li>
				<li>Administrators invite users to the platform.</li>
				<li>Security protocols are put in place to prevent unauthorized access of the platform.</li>
				<li>Campaign management features such as 'Create a Campaign', 'Start/Stop a Campaign'.</li>	
				</ul>

				<h4>2. Comparative Analysis</h4>
				<div class="headerbox">
					<h2>Fade's Proposition is a Unique Technology</h2>
				</div>
			<p>Fades proposition is a unique technology and although there are similarites in the online ad space they do not have a direct competitor. We next looked at Amazon's Seller Central's dashboard. Their business model is not an advertishing based model but there are similarities in their solutions. This was to gather more data on how these solutions are designed, and to get more inspiration.</p>

			<h2>Dashboards Are Dynamic</h2>
			<p>Due to the dynamic nature of this platform many site maps were created to show what pages each user would see. Our design had to account for that and the following images will show the maps. Here is the information architecture that we came up with.</p>

		<h2>Dashboards Are a Challenge</h2>
	
	
	
	<p class="mb-2">Dashboards are a challenging design to take on with many moving parts. This was in many ways a vey challenging project for our team. We started off with no ability to research the user and had to rely on the project brief for all of our research. In many ways we had to abondone the normal UX steps and just work with what we had.</p>
	<p>It turned out that what we had was sufficient and we were able to design by looking at other dashboards and copying their architecture and layout and use Fades business goals and needs provided to us in the project brief.</p>
