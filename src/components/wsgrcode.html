					<Typography variant="body1">
						Users need a personable experience to select an animal rescue in order to find a dog to add to their family. The user who will be going to WSGR's site  to search for and adopt a dog needs to feel a level of trust and personal touch on website. At the moment the current site is very old and chaotic and it is not serving WSGR well as far as the image.
